### Hackathon Tips — Permitting
- UpCodes has the most developer-friendly interface for code lookups.
- Building permit data may also appear in the Open Data Portal (see above).

## Submission Guidelines

Projects are submitted via MCP server. Add the submission server to Claude Code by running:

```bash
claude mcp add impact-lab-submissions --transport http https://mcp-submissions.casper-studios.workers.dev/mcp
```

For other MCP clients (e.g. Claude Desktop), add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "submissions": {
      "url": "https://mcp-submissions.casper-studios.workers.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Once added, you can submit your project directly through your MCP client using the tools provided by the `impact-lab-submissions` MCP server.

**Note:** Only your most recent submission will be reviewed. You can resubmit as many times as you like, but each new submission replaces the previous one.

### Required in Your Repo's README

Every project repo must include a README with the following:

- **Team name**
- **Team members** (names and roles)
- **Problem statement** -- what civic problem are you solving?
- **What it does** -- a short paragraph describing the application
- **Data sources used** -- which city datasets or resources your project uses
- **Architecture / approach** -- brief description (or diagram) of how the pieces fit together
- **Links** -- URL to the live application, if deployed
- **Demo video** -- a 60-second walkthrough of the application. Optional if your app is deployed and accessible via a public link; **required** if it is not.

---

## Rules

- **No early starts.** Your first commit must be after 10:30 AM on 3/7. Projects with evidence of development before that time will be disqualified.
- **Original work only.** Third-party libraries and frameworks are fine, but the core project must be built during the hackathon. No pre-existing projects.
- **One submission per team.** Each team submits one project via the MCP submission server.
- **Use city data responsibly.** Use public APIs and open data. Do not scrape or abuse city systems.
- **Code must be in a public GitHub repo.** Judges need to be able to review your code. You're free to make the repo private after the hackathon closes.

---

## Judging Criteria

Each project will be scored across four categories on a **1-5 scale** (1 = minimal, 5 = exceptional), for a **maximum of 20 points**.

---

### 1. Civic Impact (1-5)

Does this solve a real problem for San Diego residents, city staff, or the community?

Judges should ask: **Would someone actually use this?**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Addresses a clear, pressing civic need with a compelling use case |
| 4 | Solves a real problem with a well-defined audience |
| 3 | Useful concept, but the target user or problem could be sharper |
| 2 | Loosely connected to a civic use case |
| 1 | No clear civic relevance |

> **Bonus consideration:** Solutions that enable broader access -- such as MCP servers, CLIs, or agentic tools that others can build on -- should be rewarded.

---

### 2. Use of City Data (1-5)

How effectively does the project leverage San Diego's open data, municipal code, council records, or other city resources?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Deeply integrates multiple city data sources in a meaningful way |
| 4 | Strong use of at least one city data source with clear value |
| 3 | Uses city data, but doesn't go beyond surface-level access |
| 2 | Minimal or superficial use of city data |
| 1 | No meaningful use of city data |

> **Bonus consideration:** Projects that creatively combine datasets (e.g., joining permit data with zoning codes, enriching 311 data with budget info) should be rewarded.

---

### 3. Technical Execution (1-5)

Does it work? Is the demo functional and reasonably polished for a hackathon timeframe?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Fully functional, polished, and well-scoped for the time available |
| 4 | Working demo with minor rough edges |
| 3 | Core functionality works but notable gaps or bugs |
| 2 | Partially working; significant issues during demo |
| 1 | Non-functional or unable to demo |

> A focused, working MVP beats an ambitious idea that crashes during the demo. Judges should reward smart scoping.

---

### 4. Presentation & Story (1-5)

Did the team clearly communicate what they built, why it matters, and who it's for?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Compelling narrative, clear demo, and strong delivery |
| 4 | Well-structured presentation with a clear problem/solution arc |
| 3 | Adequate presentation but missing clarity on problem, audience, or impact |
| 2 | Disorganized or hard to follow |
| 1 | No clear communication of the project's purpose |

> A strong demo tells a story: here's the problem, here's how we solve it, here's what it looks like in action.

---

### Scoring Summary

| Category | Max Score |
|----------|-----------|
| Civic Impact | 5 |
| Use of City Data | 5 |
| Technical Execution | 5 |
| Presentation & Story | 5 |
| **Total** | **20** |

## Inspiration

Looking for project ideas? Here are some starting points:

1. **Claude Connector for City Data** — Build a Claude-powered connector that enables easier access to San Diego's open data, letting users ask natural-language questions about city datasets (permits, budgets, traffic, etc.) and get structured answers.

2. **MCP Server or CLI for City Data Querying** — Create an MCP server or command-line tool that wraps the Socrata/SODA API, making it easy to query, filter, and join San Diego open datasets without writing raw API calls.

3. **Council Meeting Sentiment Analyzer** — Transcribe council meeting videos (via Whisper or similar) and use Claude to analyze how individual council members feel about specific issues, tracking positions over time.

4. **Municipal Code Assistant** — A conversational tool that helps residents and developers navigate the San Diego Municipal Code — ask questions in plain English and get back relevant code sections with explanations.

5. **Permit Navigator** — An interactive guide that walks users through the building permit process step by step, determining which permits they need based on their project description and surfacing relevant code requirements.

6. **Neighborhood Issue Tracker** — Combine 311 data, code enforcement records, and police call data from the Open Data Portal to visualize and track quality-of-life issues by neighborhood over time.

7. **Budget Explorer** — An interactive visualization of the City of San Diego's budget data that lets residents explore where money goes, compare departments, and track spending trends across fiscal years.

8. **Public Records Request Assistant** — A tool that searches the 40,000+ records in NextRequest, helps users find existing requests related to their topic, and assists in drafting new records requests.

9. **Council Agenda Summarizer** — Automatically pull upcoming council and committee agendas, summarize each item in plain language, and highlight items relevant to a user's neighborhood or interests.

10. **Development Project Impact Analyzer** — Combine permit data, zoning codes, and council records to help residents understand proposed development projects in their area and their potential impact.

11. **Historical Document Search** — Build a semantic search layer over the city's digital archives, making historical documents, photos, and audio files discoverable through natural-language queries.

12. **Code Compliance Checker** — Given a property address or project description, cross-reference the building code, local amendments, and zoning regulations to flag potential compliance issues before a permit application.

13. **Council Voting Pattern Dashboard** — Aggregate council voting records from meeting minutes and results to visualize voting patterns, alliances, and how representatives align on key policy areas.
